## Overview

This project is an AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect malicious activity in network traffic. The system leverages machine learning algorithms, particularly **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, to classify network traffic and identify potential threats or intrusions.

The IDS system is trained on network traffic datasets and continuously improves its detection capabilities by learning from known attack patterns. It can be deployed in real-time environments to monitor and analyze network activities, helping to protect systems from various types of cyber attacks.

## Features

- **AI-powered detection**: Utilizes machine learning to detect anomalies and malicious behavior in network traffic.
- **Real-time monitoring**: Capable of analyzing live network traffic in real time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` (optional, for deep learning models)
- Network traffic datasets (e.g., CICIDS 2017, KDD Cup 99)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JHUA0940/AI-Based-IDS.git
   cd AI-Based-IDS
